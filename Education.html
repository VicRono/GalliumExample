			<h6 style="color:#1C2833"> In Nairobi, I attended boarding school which i was very fortunate about since recieviing an education is close to impossible if your family cannot afford it. As a child I was extremely shy so I would spent most of my time observing people and i slowly started to realize just how fortunate I am. Once we moved to Milwaukee, I attended Hartford Elementry School, just blocks away from my house. Once i graduated from the 8th grade, I attended Riverside High School and eventually transfered to Shorewood HIgh my senior season. I then attended UW-Milwaukee and did not like it...took some time off and worked, now I am at DEVCode.</h6>
